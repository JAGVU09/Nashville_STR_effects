# Nashville_STR_effects
Short term rentals (STR) have become pervasive in neighborhoods across the metro Nashville area. Some neighborhoods have been more accepting of STRs than others. Many communities may see them as party houses and nuisances while others welcome the tourism dollars they bring to the city or the opportunity for people to make money off their home as a second source of income. Iâ€™m curious what actions people take to try to slow the influx of STRs into their neighborhood and if they could be using code violations as a means to that end.
